    <h1>Contributing to MDN</h1>

<p>
MDN Web Docs needs your help! We have a                    large number of typos to fix,



examples to write, bugs to fix,
 people to talk to, and more, and the number 
 
 is growing as more people start using the site. This page

  outlines what you can do to help.

Note: If you haven't contributed to MDN previously, the Getting Started guide explains the process in four



simple steps. Good news, you're already on step 2:



"Picking a task to complete."!

<h2>What can I do to help?</h2>

<p>
    There are multiple avenues you can take to contribute to MDN depending on your skillset and interests.
     Along with each task we provide a short description and an approximate time that each type of task 
     typically takes.
